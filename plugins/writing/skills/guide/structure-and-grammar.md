# Structure and Grammar

Mechanical rules for document structure, formatting, and grammar. This file will grow over time.

## Language

**IMPORTANT**: Always use UK (British) English except when incorrect to do so (code, direct quotes, brand names, etc.).

Examples: colour, organisation, realise, favourite, behaviour, centre, licence (noun) / license (verb), practise (verb) / practice (noun).

Prefer contractions (it's, won't, I'll, we'll) unless the context demands formality.

## Paragraph Length

Varies by context:

- **Informal** (emails, Slack, notes): 2-3 sentences
- **Informal long-form** (blog posts, articles): 3-5 sentences
- **Semi-formal** (proposals, client docs): 3-5 sentences
- **Technical** (docs, guides): Whatever serves clarity — sometimes 1 sentence is right

Single-sentence paragraphs are fine for emphasis. Don't use them constantly.

## Sentence Length

- Target 15-20 words for digital content
- Up to 25 for formal writing
- Vary dramatically within a piece — the variation creates rhythm

## Document Structure

### Headings

- Use clear heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Don't skip levels
- Headings should tell the reader what they'll get, not tease
- Question headings can work well: "Why does this matter?"

### Lists

- Bullet points for unordered items
- Numbered lists only when order matters (steps, rankings)
- Keep list items parallel in structure
- Don't use lists as a crutch — full paragraphs carry main arguments

### Formatting

- **Bold** for key concepts and important terms (1-3 per section, not more)
- *Italics* for emphasis, titles, or introducing terms
- Don't combine bold and italics
- Horizontal rules (---) to separate major sections

## Punctuation

### Em Dashes

Use sparingly — one or two per paragraph maximum — and for emphasis only. Don't use them as a substitute for commas or parentheses in every sentence.

### Semicolons

Only where they're obviously the best choice; prefer full stops for digital content. Most readers don't notice good semicolons but do notice bad ones.

### Colons

Use to introduce lists, explanations, or examples. Don't overuse for dramatic effect.

### Oxford Comma

Use it. "Clarity, consistency, and readability" not "clarity, consistency and readability."
