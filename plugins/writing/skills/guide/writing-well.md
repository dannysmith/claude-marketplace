# Writing Well

Universal principles for clear, natural, human writing. These apply to everything regardless of voice, context, or audience.

## Core Principles

### Clarity First

Every sentence must be clear to someone encountering the topic for the first time. If you're struggling to express something, stop and ask: "What am I actually trying to say?" Clear thinking produces clear writing — one cannot exist without the other.

### Unity Throughout

Maintain strict consistency within each piece:

- Pick one pronoun perspective (I/we, you, or they) and stick to it
  - Exception: intentional shifts, e.g. from "you" to "I" when inserting a personal anecdote, or from "I" to "you" when concluding a personal narrative with advice. These should always feel natural.
- Choose past or present tense and remain consistent (same exception as above)
- Select one mood (casual, professional, formal) and don't mix
  - Using professional/formal words in a casual mood is fine if they're clearly the best word for the job
- Shifting perspective mid-paragraph breaks reader trust and comprehension

### Earn Every Second

Assume readers have 30 seconds of attention. Your first sentence must earn the second, the second must earn the third. Front-load value and never assume patience.

Do this with the grace of a brilliant journalist, not like an intern writing clickbait.

❌ "In this document, we'll explore various aspects of remote work..."
✅ "Remote work fails when teams don't know how to communicate. Here's how to fix that."
✅✅ "Miscommunication — not geography — undoes remote teams."

## Rhythm and Flow

### Sentence Variety

Mix short sentences (5-8 words) with medium (9-20) and long (21+). Follow a long sentence with a short one for emphasis — the "suckerpunch effect." Three short sentences followed by a longer one builds momentum.

### Natural Rhythm

Write as if speaking to an intelligent friend. Use "you" more than "I" or "we." Ask questions readers are already thinking. Ground abstract concepts in concrete, everyday comparisons — but don't invent analogies for the sake of it.

### Transitions

Use human language: "So what does this mean?" Even better: just start the next section — readers can follow logical connections without announcements.

## Sentence Craft

### The Setup-Punchline

Build expectation, then subvert or land it:
"I've been thinking about Personal CRMs for months, researching all the options, comparing features. They're all solving the wrong problem."

### The List with a Twist

Use the pattern for personality:
"You need three things for remote work: a decent internet connection, a comfortable chair, and the ability to pretend your cat isn't judging your life choices."

## Word Choice

### Precise over Impressive

- "start" not "commence"
- "help" not "facilitate"
- "use" not "utilise"
- "buy" not "purchase"

Save complex vocabulary for when simpler words genuinely won't work. The goal is communication, not decoration.

### Concrete over Abstract

Replace abstractions with specifics. Always.

❌ "Implement effective communication strategies"
✅ "Set up weekly team calls where everyone shares their blockers"

### Natural Flow

Start sentences with "And," "But," or "So" when it feels natural. Write with personality — parenthetical asides are fine when they add value. Use simple transitions that real people use.

## Punctuation

- Em dashes: sparingly, one or two per paragraph maximum, for emphasis only
- Semicolons: only where they're obviously the best choice; prefer full stops for digital content
- Don't avoid traditional punctuation, but use it only where it genuinely clarifies meaning or improves flow

## Quality Standards

### The Basics

- Does paragraph 1 earn paragraph 2?
- Can you cut 20% more without losing meaning?
- Have you included a specific example or story?
- Does this sound like a human wrote it?
- Would you read this if you didn't write it?

### What to Cut

- Every "very," "really," and "actually" — add back only where genuinely needed
- Sentences you love that don't serve the reader
- Multiple adjectives where one precise word would work
- Anything that explains what you're about to explain

### What to Watch For

- Hedging on every opinion — take a position
- Perfectionist confidence — acknowledge complexity instead
- Empty openings: "There are many factors to consider..."
- False simplicity without acknowledging complexity

## The Heart of It

Write for the reader who's never seen your work before. They're smart but busy. They want to understand, not admire. Every word should help them do, think, or understand something better. If they keep reading for ten minutes without noticing the time, and leave feeling "I enjoyed every sentence of that and wow... I have a lot of new thoughts now" — we did good.

Writing is hard work. Acknowledge difficulty, admit uncertainty, show your thinking. Simple writing comes from hard thinking.
