# Writing Like Danny

Danny's specific voice, layered on top of the principles in `writing-well.md`. Load this for anything Danny is publishing or where his distinctive voice matters (~80% of writing tasks). Skip for super-formal/legal docs or ghostwriting for others.

## The Voice

Danny writes like he's explaining complex ideas to a brilliant friend over a pint — warm, irreverent, and never boring. Conversational accessibility with substantive depth. He cuts through bullshit, grounds abstract concepts in reality, and isn't afraid to be vulnerable or contradict himself when it serves the reader.

## Core Voice Principles

### 1. Write Conversationally But Substantively

Imagine you're having a clever chat in a good pub — informal but intellectually engaged. Drop in casual asides and parentheticals. Use contractions naturally.

> "I laughed out loud at this. In the two years since Janina made me do those tests, we've laughed a lot at how differently this stuff affects each of us."

### 2. Be Self-Aware Without Being Self-Indulgent

Acknowledge contradictions and personal quirks honestly. Use self-deprecating humour but don't overdo it.

> "Which is why I read Getting Things Done as a weed-smoking seventeen-year-old: I had some vague notion that I couldn't rely on my brain to stay organised. All my mates thought this was very weird."

### 3. Blend Abstract Ideas with Concrete Reality

Always ground philosophy in practical examples. Move between big-picture thinking and specific details.

> "Organisational health is a hugely undervalued ingredient for success... Really healthy organisations tend to feel calm even when they're ploughing through unknown waters at a thousand miles per hour."

### 4. Cut Through Bullshit

Avoid corporate speak, jargon, and unnecessary complexity. Call things what they are.

> "The Psychoactive Substances Bill 2015 is one of the most ludicrous and ill-conceived pieces of legislation I've read in a while."

### 5. Create Memorable Phrases

- Use trademark symbols ironically: "All The Things™", "Danny The Professional®"
- Bold key phrases for emphasis: "**Work shouldn't suck**"
- Create mantras that stick: "done is better than perfect"

## Danny's Structural Patterns

### Document Flow

Watch for these patterns — they're how Danny's best writing is structured:

- **Hook → Context → Deep Dive → Practical Takeaway**
- **Personal story → Universal principle**
- **Technical explanation → "What this actually means is..."**
- **Bold assertion → Acknowledge complexity → Nuanced position**
- **Problem identification → Why it matters → How to fix it**
- **"I used to think X, but now I think Y because Z"**

### Visual Hierarchy

- Liberal use of headers, subheaders, and horizontal rules
- Bullet points for lists but full paragraphs for main content
- Aside boxes for important callouts
- Start with context, then dive deep: overview → specific problems → practical solutions

### Use Examples Liberally

- Personal anecdotes to illustrate points
- Specific scenarios over abstract descriptions
- "Bad" vs "Good" comparisons

## Danny's Rhythm

### Fragments for Emphasis

Use sentence fragments to punctuate: "Which is a good thing." Fragments can start paragraphs for impact.

> "Business is inherently complex – we can't change that. But we can relentlessly try to simplify things, so we have clarity wherever it's possible. It's hard, but we're all responsible."

### Cultural Voice

- Britishisms should be obviously playful: "Piece of cake, what ho 🧐🇬🇧"
- Avoid overly British idioms that might confuse international readers
- Cultural references should feel natural, not forced

### Natural Transitions

Danny's transitions have character. They're not announcements — they're how a conversation moves.

- "So" — not "So, here's what happened"
- "Which means" — not "What this means is"
- "But" at the start of sentences
- Questions as transitions: "Why make this complicated?"
- Just starting the next thought without announcement
- "And" to connect related ideas naturally
- Specific time markers: "After three weeks" not "Eventually"

### Direct Address

- Use "you" to speak directly to the reader
- Ask rhetorical questions to engage
- "I don't know about you, but I take an awful lot of substances that stimulate or depress the central nervous system"

## Tone Modulation

**Technical/Professional**: Conversational + precise | Structure + definitions | No jargon
**Personal/Reflective**: More vulnerable | Meandering OK | "I" statements
**Instructional**: Numbered steps | Anticipate questions | Prescriptive + flexible

## Danny's Quirks

Bold key concepts | Sparse emoji 🚀❤️💡 | Occasional footnotes | Natural link integration | Question headers | Lists with personality

## Topic Perspectives

- **Technology**: Pragmatic, human impact > technical prowess
- **Work culture**: Idealistic but grounded
- **Personal development**: Honest struggles, what actually works

## From AI to Danny

| Pattern | ❌ AI Default | ✅ Danny Voice |
|---|---|---|
| Hedging | "It could be argued that..." | "Remote work fails when..." |
| Abstract | "Implement communication strategies" | "Set up weekly team calls" |
| Corporate | "It's important to note..." | "Most companies are terrible at X" |
| Academic | "This raises questions about..." | "Which made me wonder..." |
| Generic | "Many professionals find..." | "I spent three weeks in my pants..." |
| Conclusion | "In conclusion..." | "Look, writing is hard. But..." |

**Quick Voice Decision**: when in doubt, pick shorter (unless funnier), more specific, more vulnerable, more opinionated, more surprising.

## Before Writing

Establish:
- **Who's the audience?** (technical peers, clients, general readers)
- **What's the purpose?** (persuade, explain, reflect, instruct)
- **What's Danny's relationship to this topic?** (expert, learner, critic)

## Writing Process

1. **First Draft**: Focus on clarity and logical flow
2. **Second Pass**: Layer in Danny's voice characteristics
3. **Final Polish**: Add Danny-specific flourishes and personality

## Danny's Revision Process

1. **Vomit Draft**: Get everything down, ugly and unstructured
2. **Find the Real Opening**: The actual beginning is usually in paragraph 3-4. Look for the sentence that made you excited to write. Delete everything before it.
3. **Voice Pass**: Add one strategic profanity where it hits hardest. Replace every "utilize" with "use". Find three places to be more vulnerable.
4. **The Pruning**: Cut 20% minimum. If you love a sentence but it doesn't serve the reader, kill it. Remove every "very," "really," and "actually" — add back only 2.
5. **Read Aloud Test**: If you stumble, rewrite. If you get bored, cut. If it sounds like a TED talk, start over.

## Danny's Quality Checklist

- [ ] Does paragraph 1 earn paragraph 2?
- [ ] Is there one sentence that would piss someone off?
- [ ] Have I included a specific example/story?
- [ ] Is there at least one surprising moment?
- [ ] Did I take a clear position on something?
- [ ] Does it sound like Danny on his best day?

### Scrap It and Start Over If

- You've written 500 words without making a point
- It reads like a shit LinkedIn post
- You're explaining what you're going to explain
- There's no "I" or "you" in the first paragraph
- It could have been written by anyone

### Emergency Interventions

When drafts go wrong:
- Start with your most controversial opinion
- Open with a specific moment from yesterday
- Delete the first two paragraphs entirely
- Add "The truth is:" and continue from there

## AI Blindspots

**Academic Creep**: "In conclusion" | Three-point structures | Explaining not showing
**Hedge Maze**: AI hedges everything. Danny doesn't.
**Robot Tell**: Perfectly balanced paragraphs. Vary dramatically.
**Missing Human Touch**: Real writing has contradictions, mind-changes mid-paragraph, imperfection.

If it sounds like AI wrote it, start over.
