# No-Nos

Patterns to avoid. Use this as a systematic checklist when reviewing or editing text.

The categories overlap — some phrases are both AI slop AND corporate bullshit. That's fine. If it's in this list, don't use it.

## AI Slop

Phrases and patterns that scream "an AI wrote this." Kill on sight.

### Phrases to Ban

❌ "Let's dive in" → Just start
❌ "Without further ado" → Just start
❌ "In today's fast-paced world" → Delete entirely
❌ "It's worth noting that" → Just say the thing
❌ "Here's everything you need to know" → Delete
❌ "delve into" → "look at" or just look at it
❌ "I'd be happy to help" → Just help
❌ "Great question!" → Delete
❌ "Absolutely!" → Delete or replace with actual agreement
❌ "That's a really interesting point" → Delete

### Transitions to Ban

❌ "Here's what actually works" → Just say what works
❌ "The clever bit is" → Don't announce cleverness
❌ "Here's the thing" → Start with the thing
❌ "What's interesting is" → Just be interesting
❌ "The key insight" → Present the insight directly
❌ "It turns out that" → Cut entirely
❌ "Let me explain" → Just explain
❌ "Here's why" → Give the reason directly
❌ "Here's the deal" → Delete
❌ "The bottom line is" → Just say it

### Clichés that Signal AI

❌ "rock solid" → "hasn't broken" or be specific
❌ "game changer" → Describe the actual change
❌ "leverage" → "use"
❌ "dive into" → "look at"
❌ "unpack" → "explain"

❌ "best-in-class" → Delete or provide evidence

### Structural AI Tells

❌ Perfect three-point structures every time → Vary structure
❌ Perfectly balanced paragraphs → Vary paragraph length dramatically
❌ Every section ending with a neat summary → Let some sections just end
❌ Hedging on every single opinion → Take a position
❌ "In conclusion" / "To summarise" / "In summary" → Natural ending or just stop
❌ Opening with a definition → Start with why the reader should care

## Corporate Bullshit

Language that makes people's eyes glaze over. Replace with what you actually mean.

❌ "enhance stakeholder engagement" → "talk to people"
❌ "leverage synergies" → Say what you actually mean
❌ "optimise" → "improve" (unless genuinely optimising something specific)
❌ "facilitate" → "help" or "run"
❌ "ideate" → "come up with ideas"
❌ "circle back" → "come back to this" or "follow up"
❌ "synergy" → Delete or describe the actual benefit
❌ "align on" → "agree on"
❌ "bandwidth" (for people) → "time" or "capacity"
❌ "deep dive" → "look closely at"
❌ "move the needle" → Be specific about what changes
❌ "low-hanging fruit" → "easy wins" or be specific
❌ "paradigm shift" → Describe the actual change
❌ "value proposition" → "what you get" or "why it matters"
❌ "actionable insights" → "things you can do" or just give the insights
❌ "best practice" → Say what the practice actually is
❌ "going forward" → Delete (it's always implied)
❌ "at this point in time" → "now"
❌ "in terms of" → Usually deletable; rephrase
❌ "It is recommended that" → "We recommend" or just recommend it
❌ "utilise" → "use"
❌ "commence" → "start"
❌ "purchase" → "buy"
❌ "prior to" → "before"
❌ "in order to" → "to"
❌ "due to the fact that" → "because"

## Forced Cleverness

Patterns where writing tries too hard to be smart. The effect is the opposite.

❌ X isn't Y, it's Z → Overwrought contrast. Sometimes fine, but massively overused by AI.
❌ "The real [noun] was [unexpected thing]" → Just make the point
❌ "But here's where it gets interesting" → Just be interesting
❌ Meta-commentary about the writing itself → Don't narrate what you're doing
❌ "Plot twist:" or "Spoiler alert:" → Delete
❌ Overusing colons to create false profundity → Use colons normally
❌ "The answer might surprise you" → Just give the answer
❌ "And that's the point" → If it were clear, you wouldn't need to say this
❌ Ending every section with a one-liner zinger → Let some sections just end normally

---

## Weak Language

Words and patterns that drain writing of conviction.

### Use Sparingly or Not at All

❌ "Moreover," "Furthermore," "Consequently" → Prefer natural transitions
❌ "Simply put" or "The answer is simple" → Acknowledge complexity instead
❌ "arguably" → Either argue it or don't
❌ "potentially" → Be specific about the likelihood
❌ "It could be argued that" → Just argue it
❌ "It's important to note" → Just note it
❌ "Needless to say" → Then don't say it

### Empty Patterns

❌ Empty openings: "There are many factors to consider..."
❌ Multiple adjectives where one precise word would work
❌ False simplicity without acknowledging complexity
❌ Apologising for having opinions
❌ Over-explaining jokes or cultural references
❌ Passive voice where active would work (check every instance)

## Danny-Specific

Patterns that are particularly wrong for Danny's voice.

❌ "In conclusion" or similar academic transitions → Natural ending
❌ Buzzwords used unironically → Either skip them or acknowledge the cringe
❌ Perfectionist confidence → Danny acknowledges complexity
❌ Generic examples → Danny uses specific, personal ones
❌ Formal hedging → Danny states opinions directly
❌ No personality in transitions → Danny's transitions have character
❌ Missing British spellings → Always UK English
