## Clay CRM — Personal/Persuasive

Source: danny.is. Demonstrates: building from personal frustration to structural insight, strategic profanity, concrete examples.

I paid a 12-month subscription for a Personal CRM called Clay because I need help "mamaging my personal and professional relationships". It's not bad software. BUT...

It turns out what I need is **not Clay**, or any other "Personal CRM" I've found.

It feels like most of these Personal CRMs are made by folks with very different problems to me.

I know a lot of founders, execs, freelancers (and salespeople) who are very good at building and maintaining their personal relationships... it's a **huge** part of their job after all. Most of them reach out to people, meet a new people and get/make a lot of useful intros on a daily basis.

For them, Clay's features are probably pretty useful. I can imagine it's useful knowing it's Andy's birthday today, and when you last spoke 9 months Andy was struggling with X, Y and Z and had a baby due in August. And that Andy's job on LinedIn changed 3 months ago. Etc. Because all that makes excellent context for a quick email to reopen a conversation.

If you read that and thought "well duuh what's a CRM for?" you're one of the founders/execs/freelancers/salesperope I'm talking about. We probably agree that the job of a personal CRM is keeping information about the people you know organised, current and readily available.

Which is exactly what all CRMs are for... sales CRMs were originally designed to help salespeople manage exactly this kind of information in a sane way, making it easier to maintain meaningful contextual relationships with customers & leads.

But that's not at all what **I need** from a "Personal CRM". If it was I'd happiliy be using a janky setup of Hubspot, Zoho, Salesforce or similar to manage my personal relationships.

What I need is a tool that solves a different set of problems. I need a tool that makes maintaining and growing my personal relationships & network easy and fun. I need a tool for people who are not good at this stuff in the first place.

I need a tool that pings me before I meet someone new and suggests context-aware questions & conversation points. I need a frictionless way to note the important bits down and resurface them appropriately. I need to know when two of my contacts have something non-obvious in common, and an easy way to intro them. I need to be magically reminded that when I last spoke to Anna from Random Startup Ltd she was excited about her family trip to Croatia, and I want that reminder (with context) 3 days after she gets home – or whn I happen to end up in Croatia myself.

When I meet people in real life I invariably have a million great conversations, intro people all over the place and get excited. I am by no means bad at building genuine relationships. I need a tool that helps me feel like that when I'm sat at my desk.

Most of all, I need a "Personal CRM" which solves an unsolved problem for me...

I need a tool that makes managing my network of personal relationships feel like the opposite of what salespeople use CRMs for.

I have a large extended network of people with whom I have potential mutually meaningful relationships. In sales parlance, they're almost all "very warm". But for the most part, none of us is trying to sell shit to each other. In common with a lot of other people in that network, I'm crap at maintaining the relationships that constitute it and even craper at cultivating the second-order ralationships that could expand it.

I need tooling to help me with that.

Since we're discussing **Personal CRM**s, here's a not-at-all-work-related take...

My housemate is amazing at maintaining her myriad personal relationships. Nothing to do with her work. She **loves** buying super-thoughtful presents for people she barely knows. She always remembers to invite randos from the pub to stuff they'd enjoy. She always remembers to message about important stuff in folks' lives. And very quickly "barely knows" doesn't apply. This is gernuine relationship building done well.

Meanwhile I'm the opposite (I'd forget my own birthday if said housemate didn't remind me). Sure, I could learn to behave like her, but it would never be natrual and I'd never get off on it the same way she does.

It feels like every Personal CRM I've seen is designed for people like my housemate, or even worse... the I-Am-At-Work equivilent of her. ie. Folks who enjoy and are somewhat good at this stuff.

Perhaps obviously, it also feels like every Personal CRM I've seen **designed by** this kind of person.

And it feels like for this kind of person the core value prop of a "Personal CRM" has already been solved by CRMs in general. (Every good salesperson I know maintains a personal CRM of sorts... none use a speciic _Personal CRM_ tool.)

it feels like at best, a _Personal CRM_ is slightly tweaked UX presented as a skin over an already-solved problem.

Meanwhile the problems I have are mostly unsolved by software. I signed up for Clay because I need help "mamaging my personal and professional relationships". But what I need is not a tool like Clay. Because everything I said above.

And I'm convinced I'm not alone here. I know too many people like me who are excellent at building deep, meaningful relationships with a few people, but can't bridge the gap to doing so more widely.

I'm equally convinced that _none of us_ is likeley to found a "Personal CRM" startup to address this.

But my goodness would we throw money at someone who did.

Does this chime with anyone else?

PS. I'd love to see Clay's churn data, segmented by a yes/no to "Do you enjoy buying gifts & organising birthday parties, and when you have amazing convos with people at conferences, do you message them afterwards?" Then label with _potential high-value customer_.

EDIT: Practical Example...

I bumped into Chase Warrington a bit ago. I've been a fan of Chase's work for ages, and very mcuch look up to him in a work context. He's exactly the kind of person that should see me stuffing everything I know about him into my "Personal CRM" so I can extract the maximum value from our relationship.

But that'd be mental because neither of us are arseholes, we've got nothing to sell each other and **fuck basing any relationship on the extraction of value**.

I want a Personal CRM that's like "Chase just interviewed someone you know on his podcast, you should listen to that one and then maybe WhatsApp them both?" or "Chase is in London right now and he'd definitely like this band you're going to see tomorrow but FYI he's here for a funeral".

## Organisational Health — Business/Professional

Source: danny.is. Demonstrates: making dry topics compelling, personal authority, sensory language, structured arguments.

For a long time I've believed that **organisational health** is a hugely undervalued ingredient for success – especially for startups that are scaling fast. **It's the silent enabler of so much else**. Before I give you my take on it, here's a succinct definition of Organisational Health...

> An organization's ability to function effectively, to cope adequately, to change appropriately, and to grow from within.

For me it's about intentionally creating a resilient, cohesive organisation that can operate with a sustained sense of **calm**.

Really healthy organisations tend to feel calm even when they're ploughing through unknown waters at a thousand miles per hour. They're able to operate on the edge of chaos without becoming chaotic.

Despite the obvious benefits of a healthy organisation, it's often neglected – I think for a few reasons...

1. It seems **kinda boring** – we're conditioned to believe the best solutions come from fancy, innovative approaches. Being healthy isn't complex or innovative... but it does takes sustained **effort**. And there's none of the adrenaline which usually comes with startup leadership.
2. It's **very hard to quantify results**. The best measurements of organisational health are whatever we use to measure general success (growth, revenue etc) but this makes it very hard to measure the effect of work. As always, _useful_ proxy metrics are hard to find.
3. It needs a **holistic approach** - it cuts across leadership, operations and people functions, as well as every other function in a business. Which makes it hard.
4. Founders are often **unskilled in this domain** – the skills needed to grow a healthy organisation often feel quite at odds with the other skills required to be a good founder. (Some only realise this when the wheels fall off but I've met a lot who realised from the start, felt horribly inadequate as leaders and stuck their heads in the sand.)

Remote and distributed companies need to be **much healthier** than office-based firms because co-location allows us to paper over **an awful lot of cracks**. And systemic health problems have a disproportionately large effect on remote teams, which quickly compounds with scale.

Short answer: **as soon as you reasonably can.**

Small, young companies get disproportionally large gains from the effort, which **compound over time**. Without the right foundations this all gets exponentially harder as you scale (and as your collective habits and ways of working become entrenched). I've seen way too many companies ignore this stuff until they've raised a Series B and the wheels start falling off.

## AI and ADHD — Personal Experience

Source: danny.is. Demonstrates: personal vulnerability, building from specific to universal, casual self-deprecation, philosophical depth without pretension.

My friend Vicki's "mate have you considered maybe youse got ADHD" was the first time I remember this topic coming up. That was maybe six years back, and I promptly forgot about it. Then, two years ago – while ADHD was all the rage on TikTok – my friend Janina had a period of revalation about herself and made me do a bunch of tests. Turns out I probably have Adult ADHD.

I laughed out loud at this. In the two years since Janina made me do those tests, we've laughed a lot at how differently this stuff affects each of us. The venn diagram of our symptoms barely overlaps.

My own reaction was one of mild interest. Because while _"you very obviously have ADHD"_ was news to me, **not one of the symtoms was**. I've always held the view that these "symptoms" were just kinda _how my brain is_. Sure, they make me super-shit at a bung of things, but they also make weirdly great at other things. Whether I like it or not, they're how my brain is. And always has been.

This muted reaction is partly because I've been an accidental stoic from a young age – I've always thought it insane to try to control the uncontriollable. Things are how they are and unless we can **actually** change them, and if we can't it's better to embrace reality and look for what we can change. I can no more control the symptoms I circled above than I can my emotions. But I can control how I **respond** to them.

I realised years ago that my brain was a bit weird. I also realised that any attempt to fndamentally change it was utterly exhausting, felt turbo-shit, and – most importantly – **didn't work at all**. And if I couldn't change how my brain worked, the only sensible response was to happily accept reality, and focus on useful things I **could change**.

Which is why I read Getting Things Done as a weed-smoking seventeen-year-old: I had some vague notion that I couldn't rely on my brain to stay organised. All my mates thought this was very weird. When – like most folks who read it – I failed to stick to the "GTD Way" for more than a minute, I took the bits that **actually helped me** and left the rest. And I've kinda been doing that ever since.

The result is: I'm self-employed, work remotely for multiple clients and intentionally avoid anything requiring a fixed 9-5 or Mon-Fri schedule. I write **everything** down immediatly, lest it's gone when my mental context changes 10 seconds later. Every time-based thing goes straight in my calendar, which is always with me. I own an Apple Watch specifically to poke me when I have meetings. I've internalised a bunch of habits which keep my physical space tidy without the need to focus on it. I have hard rules to avoid impulse purchases and hasty big decisions (fundamentally: "always sleep on it"). _I could go on like this..._

The point is: I've been finding out how to work _well_ with my own brain for decades. Far from being exhausting, the kinda stuff above is **liberating** and **feels easy**. Figuring this stuff out, however, is often _not_ easy. But the hard work is always the **figuring out**, not the sustained doing. Because if sustained doing is hard, I haven't figured it out yet.

Weather you have ADHD or not, finding ways to work **with** your brain rather than _against_ it will never be a bad thing.

## Why Do I Teach? — Personal Essay

Source: Medium. Demonstrates: starting with a real moment, quick pivot to reflection, numbered insights, concise philosophical depth.

I was speaking with Ben Allen today and the conversation led me to an interesting thought. If you'd asked me yesterday why I teach, I'd have said it was because I like helping people get better, I like talking, and I really enjoy it.

Today though, I gave that question a little more thought…

I have an insatiable desire to learn things. All The Things™. This does't just apply to things within my own field, either — I'd be just as interested in having a day-long tutorial on flower arranging as on something technical.

But on reflection, learning a thing isn't enough. When something I learn excites me — and that's almost everything — I want to teach others about it. I'm pretty sure this is a learned behaviour, and that it does two things:

1. It forces me to solidify my thoughts on the subject and by considering how I can best help others understand it, I often make new connections with existing knowledge. It also forces me to learn the details. (I learned more about the inner workings of the Ruby programming language while designing a 5-day course for beginners than I did in the previous 8 years writing it almost daily.)
2. Having knowledge in my head isn't particularly useful unless I apply it regularly. If I were to learn flower-arranging, I'd probably use it once a year. If I were to be hit by a bus, the effort of learning it would be wasted. But if I can teach three other people about it (who get some satisfaction), the effort was worthwhile. It had an effect beyond just me.

I also realised I've designed very few lessons or courses which didn't require significant learning on my part. I either had to learn a whole new subject (usually one close to something I knew), or had to go back to basics and learn the fundamentals in absolute detail — which is hard when the knowledge or skill has become second-nature (see Stage 5 from The Brothers Dreyfus). The few lessons I've designed which didn't require learning have not been very good.

In addition, the knowledge that I'll inevitably learn stuff by building material is a powerful motivator to keep doing so, rather than lapse into the comfortable role of a trainer who's built his material and lives only to deliver it.

## Website Redesign Part 2 — Personal/Reflective

Source: danny.is. Demonstrates: thinking in public, vulnerability about creative process, self-imposed constraints, mixing emotional and practical analysis.

Until now, every time I've redesigned this website it's been because I didn't like how it looked. Every few years, I've looked at it and felt like it doesn't adequately represent me.

When I started _this_ redesign process, I fully expected to feel the same way. But having spent a bunch of time staring at it, I think I still like a lot of what I have.

More accurately, I still **really** like these two pages...

When I designed them back in 2016 I was going for a modern "Swiss" influenced kinda vibe. I think I want to keep that.

But let's take a step back for a second and think about my goals.

### Goals of this site

First and foremost, it's a personal expression of me. It's a place for me to **have fun**: both with my writing and with design & CSS. So it's okay if it's a bit goofy or stuff is a bit broken sometimes.

But it also represents me professionally.

Thankfully, in both cases the primary goal remains the same. **To help the reader understand me – Danny.**

If I put my UX hat on for a minute, there is a Job To Be Done that I should consider. A subset of visitors to this site are trying to find out if I'm the right person to help them with something.

Similarly – with my marketing and I-need-money-to-eat hat on – there is another subset of visitors that need my help; but neither of us know it yet.

The last thing I want is for my personal site to be some sort of super-optimised landing page for **Danny The Professional&reg;**. Because that's no fun. And it's not at all an expression of me. But I do need to consider these special use cases _a bit_.

Of course, there are also the random folk who come here to read the stuff I write. They probably just wanna read in peace.

So if I think in terms of actors and their goals:

- **Danny**
  - Express himself freely and without constraint.
  - Have fun. With writing, design and code.
  - Connect with people he can help, or who can help him.
- **Interested reader**
  - Read Danny's words in peace.
  - (Perhaps) be notified when Danny writes some new words.
- **Person checking Danny out**
  - Find out if Danny is the right person to help them.
  - Contact Danny.

This feels like a good set of goals to start with. But they come in a strict order of priority: Danny → Interested Reader → Person Checking Danny Out. This is my personal website, after all.

So here's a rule I'm gonna try to stick to:

> Given a choice between what I want to do and what I feel I should do because [reasons], always choose the former.

### Goals of this redesign

As I said in Part I, I'm doing this primarily for two reasons:

1. I want a simpler, more technology-agnostic website.
2. I want to write here, not on Medium.

Combined with the website goals up there, I think I'm trying to achieve the following:

1. Represent myself more authentically.
2. Simplify my own mental model for who I am and what I do, as expressed through this site.
3. Make things more obvious and useful to readers.
4. Put my writing at the front, and make it beautiful.
5. Provide somewhere for folks to find out about my work, and how I might be able help them.

I suspect (2) and (3) mean better content organisation and hierarchy, along with some self-imposed constraints. (4) probably means better typography and more focus on the tiny details. As for (5) – that's probably just a page of its own.

The first one is interesting though. I said earlier that I like the current design. For the first time ever it still feels authentic now that _Redesign Time_ has rolled up. And so it does. At least what there is of it.

And perhaps that's the problem. My current site is too sparse. Too sanitised. Sure, it has some wacky angles and stuff. But it has no _substance_.

It also feels a bit cold and unloved. Like a well-machined tool that rarely gets used.

I'd much rather it felt like a hand-made tool that's used and loved every day. It'll probably have more dents and scratches, but it will feel much more like _home_.

### Representing Danny more authentically

I recently asked some friends to describe me using as many single words/short phrases as they wanted. The list so far has been a great prompt for reflection and has led me to a fair few blind spots, but I'm still waiting for a lot of folks to come back to me.

I'm hoping that this will help identify some words that I feel authentically represent me.

More on this later.

### So where are we at?

Besides the fact that I like my current website, we've identified three main actors and their goals. We've also established five initial goals for this redesign, and expanded on the most important of them.

Back in Part I I listed four values that felt right as guides for this project.

- Simple
- Beautiful
- Authentic
- Content-first

They still feel right to me. And they now have bit more flesh on them.

### What about my current website?

Before wrapping this up, I want to take a look at my current website with all this thinking in the back of my mind. I particularly want to look at the two pages I like – the homepage and the 404. Here are some unedited thoughts on them:

1. They _are_ simple.
2. They put the content first – even though there is hardly any of it.
3. There should be more content.
4. I think the 404 page is beautiful. I love how the colour, type and layout interact.
5. The homepage is less beautiful. Futura looks pretty bad at very large sizes and the whole thing feels slightly unpolished somehow. It lacks attention to the little details. Inauthentic.
6. Futura is a lazy choice of typeface - I use it everywhere.
7. The 404 page feels like an authentic representation of me. The homepage less so. This might have more to do with the content than the deign. I talk **a lot** and am generally friendly, and it feels a bit too minimalist and impersonal. It's somehow not goofy enough, where the 404 page is. At least the palette feels warm ad cosy.
8. I'm going for a kinda Bauhaus/Swiss vibe but there's no grid. I'm a massive nerd for orderly systems and grids, so this feels both inauthentic and like a missed opportunity to create some beauty through mathematics.

Until next time.

## The Psychoactive Substances Bill — Political Commentary

Source: Medium. Demonstrates: stating position clearly, using official language against itself, structuring complex arguments, mixing serious analysis with strategic humour.

The Psychoactive Substances Bill 2015 is one of the most ludicrous and ill-conceived pieces of legislation I've read in a while. It was announced in the Queen's Speech in May 2015 and was passed from the Lords to the Commons on 22 July 2015. It is intended to:

> make it an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess with intent to supply, import or export psychoactive substances; that is, any substance intended for human consumption that is capable of producing a psychoactive effect.

It makes it illegal to produce, supply, import or export any psychoactive substance. While it's still legal to posess such a substance, it must be in a small enough quantity to avoid appearing as though it were intended for supply.

It defines a psychoactive substance as "any substance which is capable of producing a psychoactive effect in a person who consumes it, and is not an exempted substance". A substance is deemed to produce a psychoactive effect if, "by stimulating or depressing the person's central nervous system, it affects the person's mental functioning or emotional state".

> "by stimulating or depressing the person's central nervous system, it affects the person's mental functioning or emotional state"

I don't know about you, but I take an awful lot of substances that stimulate or depress the central nervous system in order to affect mental functioning and emotional state. I eat food, for example.

Of course, not even the current government is stupid enough to try to ban food — it's exempt from the Bill along with alcohol, nicotine, tobacco, caffeine and medicinal products.

Everything else, basically. It's supposed to be a response to recent increases in the recreational use of New/Novel Psychoactive Substances, or NPS.

If you've never heard the term NPS, a recent report by a Scottish harm reduction charity called Crew has this to say…

> NPS are more commonly known as legal highs, as many of them are legal and they are designed to have psychoactive effects. The effect, duration and appearance of the drug will vary but most NPS are chemicals produced in a lab and come in powder, pill or herbal form. A liquid version, containing synthetic cannabinoids, is available for use in e-cigarettes/vapourizers. NPS are also known as novel/new drugs, legal highs and legals and are usually branded with names which are euphemistic and misrepresentative. Examples would include herbal extracts, room incense, novelty collectors' items and research chemicals.

The most common NPS are generally stimulants — used in place of cocaine, MDMA and the like — and synthetic cannabinoids.

Reading Annex 2 to the report, you'd be forgiven for thinking it provides all the evidence needed to ban NPS outright. It paints the usual bleak picture of harmful drug misuse — needles, psychosis, paranoia and all. The fact that many of these "legal highs" are packaged to look like sweets — specifically to appeal to teenagers (we're told) — makes them seem even more dangerous. In Crew's research, the most commonly occuring stimulat packets are from a brand called Blue Stuff, featuring a stylised picture of Heisenberg, the fictional meth-baron from Breaking Bad.

I don't doubt that this country has a slight problem with NPS, but it has a bigger problem with illegal drug use. While reliable statistics are hard to come by, anecdotal evidence from those involved with harm reduction puts festival drug use at 80% MDMA and only 5% NPS. Despite this, I'm told that use of NPS is a particular problem because most should be taken at much lower doses than more traditional drugs, and there's scant information on dosage. Of course, this is true of MDMA too, as this report from the Global Drug Survey shows.

Many would argue that the legality of NPS must be a big motivator for buyers. Surely people would rather buy legal drugs than illegal ones? It's interesting to note that the 2014 Home Office Review into NPS in England found that "for the majority of users, evidence suggests that legality is not the biggest motivator". To me, this is quite obvious. The illegality of illicit drugs doesn't stop people taking them, after all.

A proper discussion on the best approach to tackling drug problems is worthy of its own article, so for now I'll limit myself to suggesting that the problem — both with legal and illegal drugs — is not nearly as bad as the media would have us believe, and the NPS issue certainly doesn't warrant such an all-encompassing new law.

While the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 is permissive legislation, the new bill is restrictive. Not only will it reduce (so government hopes) the recreational use of NPS, but other classes of substance will get caught in its net.

Smart drugs have been the topic of much conversation in the last few years. From university students to tech entrepreneurs, drugs like Modafinil, Ritalin and Adderall are being used to improve focus, alertness and memory — usually with fewer negative side-affects than excessive caffeine use. Of course, like other NPS, these can be abused too. Indeed, the Blue Stuff mentioned above is actually just ethylphenidate (an analogue of methylphenidate, aka Ritalin).

The dictionary definition of Nootropic is "a substance that enhances cognition and memory and facilitates learning", and while stimulants like Modafinil are sometimes called Nootropics, most experts have a much stricter definition. Dr Corneliu Giurgea, who coined the term in 1972, defined them thus:

1. Enhance learning and memory.
2. Enhance learned behaviors under conditions known to disrupt them.
3. Protect the brain from physical or chemical injury.
4. Enhance the tonic cortical/subcortical control mechanisms.
5. Exhibit few side effects and extremely low toxicity, while lacking the pharmacology of typical psychotropic drugs (motor stimulation, sedation, etc.).

Although there's still no exact agreement on how to define the term, the definition above is very different to the image most people have of smart drugs. Nootropics are not so far away from the health supplements and vitamins many of us take every day. Indeed, supplements like fish oil, choline and L-theamine (found in green tea) are essential parts of most nootropic "stacks".

A large part of our society tends to put drugs into four main boxes:

- Non-prescription medical — "I use these every day to stave off headaches and the like, they must be safe. I also take all these supplements because my health magazine told me that 6000 mg of Vitamin C was good for weight loss."
- Prescription medical drugs — "I'm not a doctor so I couldn't possibly understand the pharmacology — there are so many long words! I just trust my GP."
- Socially acceptable non-drug drugs — "Caffeine, alcohol and nicotine aren't really drugs are they."
- Bad, horrible, nasty drugs — "If my son took any of these things I don't know what I'd do. He'll ruin his life and end up like those people in Requiem for a Dream."

Smart drugs and nootropics inevitably end up in the last box (unless they're available at Holland & Barret, then they're in the first one).

It should be fairly obvious that these boxes are artificially constructed — built with political rhetoric, hermetically sealed by drug laws and regularly repainted by the media — it is incredibly difficult to move something from one box to another.

**Tom Brake MP:**

> Does the Prime Minister believe that once a healthier relationship is established between politicians and the media, it will be easier for Governments to adopt evidence-based policy in relation to, for instance, tackling drugs?

**David Cameron:**

> That's a lovely idea.

To help explain why I think this new Bill is so ridiculous, I'd like to spend a minute looking at why people take drugs in the first place. While it's impossible to neatly categorise everybody's motivation, I think that the vast majority of people take psychoactive substances for one of the following four reasons.

**To broaden the mind** — While many people take psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin (and to some extent MDMA) with the sole intent of having a good time, a great many people do so in order to broaden their understanding of the world. I'm no expert on this, so instead I encourage you to read or listen to Sam Harris' intelligent and eloquently written article on the subject. Sam is a neuroscientist and philosopher with a PhD in cognitive neuroscience from UCLA (and he has a lovely reading voice).

**To have fun** — By far the biggest set of recreational drug-takers are occasional. I'd love to provide accurate data, but it's notoriously difficult to come by. I know hundreds of people who take both legal and illegal drugs on occasion, with the sole intent of having a good night out. For some it's a once-every-few-months thing; for others it happens every weekend. I can't speak for the rest of the country, but in Brighton and London it's only a little less usual than liking craft beer. Most of these people would never admit it in print for fear of the consequences should their family or employers find out.

**To improve their performance and health** — Health-conscious fitness enthusiasts with a penchant for kale and almond-milk smoothies are not the first people that spring to mind when we talk about psychoactive substances. Yet there are a growing number of people who are turning to smart drugs and nootropics to improve their mental health and reduce their susceptibility to diseases like Alzheimer's. Like many who use substances to broaden the mind, they are often well-informed. Not all nootropics are psychoactive substances, of course, but many are.

**To escape from an unpleasant reality** — This applies as much to the over-worked City trader who's addicted to cocaine as it does to the unemployed heroin addict in Liverpool who's lost all hope of finding a job. If fact, it applies to a whole lot of people — right across the social spectrum. In my experience, it is in this class that drug use tends to turn into misuse. Kindness, compassion and (where necessary) medical help is the solution. Not prohibition. I can't imagine the recent welfare reforms will do much to help this set.

The problem with a broad-ranging and restrictive law like this new bill is that it fails to take account of these motivations. The reason someone takes a psychoactive substance has a profound effect on the likelihood of their use turning into mis-use.

I have no data to back it up, but I'm willing to bet that the single biggest indicator of whether drugs affect someone positively or negatively (in the medium to long term) is not the drug itself, but the intent and social situation of the person taking it.

It is the social problems leading to chronic or harmful misuse which government must address, not the use itself.

The chief motivation for the widespread introduction of drug controls in the early 1970's was the fear that habitual drug use — led at the time by psychedelics and cannabis — was damaging the fabric of society. They were probably right. To quote Sam Harris:

> For every insight of lasting value produced by drugs [in the 1960's], there was an army of zombies with flowers in their hair shuffling toward failure and regret. Turning on, tuning in, and dropping out is wise, or even benign, only if you can then drop into a mode of life that makes ethical and material sense and doesn't leave your children wandering in traffic.

Yet this motivation can hardly be applied to modern-day drug taking. The use of illicit drugs like cocaine and MDMA is incredibly widespread. Despite being illegal, many friends from my early 20's took excessive amounts of both (and much more besides). All are now what society might call "successful". From youth worker to Army Captain to City trader and teacher, all contribute much to society. They certainly don't damage its fabric.

When applied to smart drugs and nootropics, the argument is even weaker. Where drug-taking in the 60's was fuelled by a desire to escape the shackles of established society, the use of these drugs is fuelled by the opposite. They exist explicitly to make people more productive, whether in education or work.

To introduce effective drug control legislation we must base our laws on sound evidence. A little while ago, New Zealand decided to tackle their problem with NPS. I'll let Ian Dunt explain:

> The government came to a sensible solution. It would offer drug designers the chance to get approval for their products if they could convince a Psychoactive Substances Regulatory Authority they were safe. It was a great idea and passed with just one vote against. And then it all went wrong. Because the world is sillier than any of us are really prepared to admit, it went wrong not because of a backlash by drug prohibitionists, but because of animal rights activists. The interim licensing sections were repealed and a section added banning the advisory committee from authorising a product where the trial for its use involved the use of an animal. Putting aside the eccentricities of Kiwi politics for a moment, the reasonable original proposal was profoundly dangerous for supporters of the war on drugs. It threatened the idea that drugs must be banned, regardless of harm, out of some quasi-religious anti-intoxification agenda. It introduced the notion that drug regulation should take place on the basis of evidence of harm, rather than some sort of historic crusade. Basically, it was sensible. And because it was sensible, it was a threat to the global system of drug regulation.

### Specifically, though. What's my problem?

In short, the Psychoactive Substances Bill is an ill-conceived piece of legislation that was heavily criticised by the government's own Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs. In addition to the points they raised in their letter to the Home Secretary, I have the following concerns:

1. It does nothing to account for the causes of misuse, or to promote education about the risks. It does the opposite and potentially criminalises a great many otherwise law-abiding citizens.
2. The UK doesn't usually enact restrictive "blanket-ban" laws like this.
3. It cannot be sensible to ban all drugs that might be developed in the future unless the Home Secretary has given his express permission for them to be un-banned. It will hinder research in the UK.
4. It will inevitably tie up police and border agency staff in less-than-useful work, preventing them from addressing more important issues. It is also likeley to be unenforceable — a similar bill in Ireland has led to very few convictions. Lord Paddick, former Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police was not a fan.
5. It is not based in any scientific evidence of harm.

As a final thought, I cannot help but question the timing of this bill. There was some discussion in the Lords, thanks mainly to Baroness Hamwee and Lord Paddick, but with all attention on the Chancellor's recent welfare reforms I can't help but wonder if this will pass in the Commons with very little debate.
