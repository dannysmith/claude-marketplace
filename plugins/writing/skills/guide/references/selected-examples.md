## 1. Personal/Persuasive — Clay CRM Review

Danny at his most distinctive: personal frustration → structural insight → passionate conclusion. Note the conversational asides, the building argument, and the strategic profanity at the end.

> I paid a 12-month subscription for a Personal CRM called Clay because I need help "mamaging my personal and professional relationships". It's not bad software. BUT...
>
> It turns out what I need is **not Clay**, or any other "Personal CRM" I've found.
>
> It feels like most of these Personal CRMs are made by folks with very different problems to me.

[builds argument about who CRMs are actually designed for, then:]

> What I need is a tool that pings me before I meet someone new and suggests context-aware questions & conversation points. I need a frictionless way to note the important bits down and resurface them appropriately. I need to know when two of my contacts have something non-obvious in common, and an easy way to intro them. I need to be magically reminded that when I last spoke to Anna from Random Startup Ltd she was excited about her family trip to Croatia, and I want that reminder (with context) 3 days after she gets home – or whn I happen to end up in Croatia myself.

[then the turn to personal example:]

> My housemate is amazing at maintaining her myriad personal relationships. Nothing to do with her work. She **loves** buying super-thoughtful presents for people she barely knows. She always remembers to invite randos from the pub to stuff they'd enjoy. This is gernuine relationship building done well.
>
> Meanwhile I'm the opposite (I'd forget my own birthday if said housemate didn't remind me).

[closing with punch:]

> I want a Personal CRM that's like "Chase just interviewed someone you know on his podcast, you should listen to that one and then maybe WhatsApp them both?" or "Chase is in London right now and he'd definitely like this band you're going to see tomorrow but FYI he's here for a funeral".

**What to emulate**: Start with personal frustration. Build from specific annoyance to structural insight. Use profanity strategically. End with concrete example that crystallises the argument.

## 2. Business/Professional — Organisational Health

Making a dry business topic compelling. Note the personal authority ("For a long time I've believed"), the sensory language, and the numbered barriers.

> For a long time I've believed that **organisational health** is a hugely undervalued ingredient for success – especially for startups that are scaling fast. **It's the silent enabler of so much else**.
>
> Really healthy organisations tend to feel calm even when they're ploughing through unknown waters at a thousand miles per hour. They're able to operate on the edge of chaos without becoming chaotic.
>
> Despite the obvious benefits of a healthy organisation, it's often neglected – I think for a few reasons...
>
> 1. It seems **kinda boring** – we're conditioned to believe the best solutions come from fancy, innovative approaches. Being healthy isn't complex or innovative... but it does takes sustained **effort**.
> 2. It's **very hard to quantify results**. The best measurements of organisational health are whatever we use to measure general success (growth, revenue etc) but this makes it very hard to measure the effect of work.
> 3. It needs a **holistic approach** - it cuts across leadership, operations and people functions, as well as every other function in a business. Which makes it hard.
> 4. Founders are often **unskilled in this domain** – the skills needed to grow a healthy organisation often feel quite at odds with the other skills required to be a good founder.

**What to emulate**: Open with personal conviction. Define terms simply. Use bold for key phrases. Number and explain barriers to make abstract problems concrete. Sensory metaphors for abstract concepts.

## 3. Personal Essay — Why Do I Teach?

Short, vulnerable, gets to deep insight quickly. Note the "All The Things™" quirk and the building from personal to universal.

> I was speaking with Ben Allen today and the conversation led me to an interesting thought. If you'd asked me yesterday why I teach, I'd have said it was because I like helping people get better, I like talking, and I really enjoy it.
>
> Today though, I gave that question a little more thought…
>
> I have an insatiable desire to learn things. All The Things™. This does't just apply to things within my own field, either — I'd be just as interested in having a day-long tutorial on flower arranging as on something technical.
>
> But on reflection, learning a thing isn't enough. When something I learn excites me — and that's almost everything — I want to teach others about it. I'm pretty sure this is a learned behaviour, and that it does two things:
>
> 1. It forces me to solidify my thoughts on the subject and by considering how I can best help others understand it, I often make new connections with existing knowledge.
> 2. Having knowledge in my head isn't particularly useful unless I apply it regularly. If I were to learn flower-arranging, I'd probably use it once a year. If I were to be hit by a bus, the effort of learning it would be wasted. But if I can teach three other people about it (who get some satisfaction), the effort was worthwhile. It had an effect beyond just me.

**What to emulate**: Start with a real moment. Quick pivot to reflection. Numbered insights for clarity. Keep philosophical pieces short. Trademark symbols for personality.

## 4. Personal Experience — AI and ADHD

Personal vulnerability grounding a broader point. Note how Danny quotes others then relates directly to his own experience.

> My own reaction was one of mild interest. Because while _"you very obviously have ADHD"_ was news to me, **not one of the symtoms was**. I've always held the view that these "symptoms" were just kinda _how my brain is_. Sure, they make me super-shit at a bung of things, but they also make weirdly great at other things. Whether I like it or not, they're how my brain is. And always has been.
>
> Which is why I read Getting Things Done as a weed-smoking seventeen-year-old: I had some vague notion that I couldn't rely on my brain to stay organised. All my mates thought this was very weird.
>
> The point is: I've been finding out how to work _well_ with my own brain for decades. Far from being exhausting, the kinda stuff above is **liberating** and **feels easy**. Figuring this stuff out, however, is often _not_ easy. But the hard work is always the **figuring out**, not the sustained doing. Because if sustained doing is hard, I haven't figured it out yet.

**What to emulate**: Use personal experience to illustrate universal points. Bold for emphasis on key insights. Italics for internal emphasis. Build from specific to universal. Casual self-deprecation that serves the argument.

## 5. Internal Documentation — Onboarding Guide (excerpt)

Professional voice that stays warm and human. Note the clear principles, the specific fictional walkthrough, and the "we" voice.

> First impressions matter. We need new hires at Oyster to have a great first impression. This is the **main design goal** of our onboarding process.
>
> Our onboarding process is designed with a few principles in mind...
>
> - **Effective onboarding is long** — Bringing someone new into our company is not something that can be done in a few days. We don't consider someone to be "onboarded" until they've _really_ become part of Oyster's fabric.
> - **Make it easy and obvious** — Joining a new company is scary. Joining a remote, globally distributed company is even scarier. We do everything we can to make things easy and obvious for new hires.
> - **Company first, then Team** — The onboarding experience should focus on the common basics **first**, then on role-specific stuff. This makes best use of a new joiner's initial enthusiasm.
> - **Starting ASAP ≠ Maximum Effectiveness** — Although it might seem like a good idea for new hires to start immediately, it usually leads to a sub-par experience for them and it takes longer for them to become effective.

**What to emulate**: Clear audience definition upfront. Principles before practices. Bold key concepts within sentences. Warm voice even in process documentation. Anticipate questions.

## 6. Technical Proposal — A Case for Using Remix

Honest technical advocacy that acknowledges bias upfront and balances enthusiasm with genuine risk assessment. Note the Extremely Smart™ quirk and the ChatGPT punchline.

> Remix is a modern full-stack framework built on top of React and React Router. It's an attractive option for building the web and backend of our product. This document explains why I think so, and looks at some of the advantages and risks.

[builds case with clear sections, then honest about risks:]

> It's not all roses though – there are some obvious risks associated with choosing to build on top of Remix.
>
> **It's Kinda New** — It's a relatively new framework at less than two years old, which raises three main worries:
>
> 1. Is it technically mature enough for production use?
> 2. Is it just a cool passing fad?
> 3. What important stuff have the core team not worked out yet or anticipated?
>
> I'm much less worried about these than when I first started looking at Remix, because the people involved are Extremely Smart™ and well-known in the React & JavaScript communities.

[closing with conviction while inviting challenge:]

> Our only priority right now is to **build a high quality product and get it to market**. And in that context, I've convinced myself that we'd be insane to not build on top of Remix. The advantages far outweigh the cons in my mind, and the risks are more easily mitigated than I expected.
>
> I asked ChatGPT to challenge me on this proposal and it wasn't much help. Human brains required, please.

**What to emulate**: Acknowledge bias upfront. Balance advocacy with honest risk assessment. Use clear sections for skimmability. End with conviction while inviting challenge.

## 7. Political Commentary — The Psychoactive Substances Bill

Sharp, opinionated writing about policy. Opens with clear position, uses official language against itself to reveal absurdity, structures a complex argument with well-placed humour.

> The Psychoactive Substances Bill 2015 is one of the most ludicrous and ill-conceived pieces of legislation I've read in a while.

[quotes the bill's own language, then turns it against itself:]

> I don't know about you, but I take an awful lot of substances that stimulate or depress the central nervous system in order to affect mental functioning and emotional state. I eat food, for example.

[structures argument into four categories of why people take drugs, then:]

> I have no data to back it up, but I'm willing to bet that the single biggest indicator of whether drugs affect someone positively or negatively (in the medium to long term) is not the drug itself, but the intent and social situation of the person taking it.
>
> It is the social problems leading to chronic or harmful misuse which government must address, not the use itself.

**What to emulate**: State position clearly and early. Use official quotes to highlight absurdity. Structure complex topics with clear categories. Mix serious analysis with strategic humour.

## 8. Personal/Reflective — Website Redesign Part 2

Thinking in public. Vulnerability about creative process, self-imposed constraints, mixing emotional and practical analysis. Note the tool metaphor.

> Until now, every time I've redesigned this website it's been because I didn't like how it looked. Every few years, I've looked at it and felt like it doesn't adequately represent me.

[sets up actors and goals with clear hierarchy, then the vulnerable turn:]

> And perhaps that's the problem. My current site is too sparse. Too sanitised. Sure, it has some wacky angles and stuff. But it has no _substance_.
>
> It also feels a bit cold and unloved. Like a well-machined tool that rarely gets used.
>
> I'd much rather it felt like a hand-made tool that's used and loved every day. It'll probably have more dents and scratches, but it will feel much more like _home_.

[self-imposed constraint:]

> Given a choice between what I want to do and what I feel I should do because [reasons], always choose the former.

**What to emulate**: Share thinking process, not just conclusions. Use metaphors that connect to craftsmanship. Mix emotional and practical analysis. Self-imposed constraints that reflect values.

## 9. Meta-Documentation — About this Notion

Internal documentation that practices what it preaches. Memorable principles, progressive depth, acknowledges human limitations. The whole document exemplifies every principle it describes.

> This is Delocate's central hub – our control centre.

[design principles that stick:]

> **Make it obvious** — No magic. To someone who knows how notion works, everything in our workspace should be very obvious. Things should be as simple as possible, but no simpler.
>
> **Make it pretty** — People tend to use things when they get pleasure from using them. And they tend to take better care of things that are beautiful.
>
> **Keep it flat** — Deep hierarchies make it hard to find stuff and even harder to understand where things should go.
>
> **Enforce structure only where it's needed** — Not everything in notion needs to be super neat and structured. A lot of pages _should_ be minimal and messy.

[closing with warmth:]

> We're all jointly responsible for pruning our notion. We're all Notion Gardeners.
>
> Green fingers FTW.

**What to emulate**: Create memorable, simple principles. Progressive depth (simple → complex). The document itself exemplifies what it teaches. Acknowledge human limitations. Warm even in process docs.

## 10. Technical Narrative — Definition of Done

Technical process documentation framed as a story. Real checklist items, acknowledges controversy, connects engineering practices to business outcomes. Shows evolution of thinking.

> Scrum defines the Definition of Done in pretty simple terms: it's the acceptance criteria that are common to every single user story.

[reframes the question:]

> Is a new feature "done" when it's in production and being used by customers? It might be. Equally, it might not. Have we published the changelog? Have we emailed our customers to tell them about the feature?
>
> The definition of "done" depends on the task.

[after the detailed checklist, acknowledges flexibility:]

> It's worth noting that these rules apply to every single work item that goes through our task boards, so long as it involves code. Whether it's a large user story with multiple dependencies or a tiny bugfix, the person doing the work is expected to run through these checklists.
>
> That doesn't mean that everything on the checklists has to be ticked off for every work item, though. It does mean that everything in the checklist must be considered for every work item. We trust our engineers to use their judgement.

[ends with openness:]

> Our "Definition of Done" is designed to help us work better and faster, and will change and evolve alongside our business goals.

**What to emulate**: Frame technical topics as stories. Include specific, real examples. Acknowledge different viewpoints ("Some engineers would argue..."). Connect technical decisions to business context. End with invitation for engagement.
