## General

- **UK English always** (colour, organisation, realise, favourite, behaviour, centre)
- **Oxford comma**: always use it
- **Contractions**: prefer them (it's, won't, we'll, I'll) unless formality demands otherwise
- **Numbers**: spell out one to nine, use digits for 10+. Exceptions: ages, percentages, measurements
- **Dates**: 14 February 2026, not February 14, 2026
- **Times**: use am/pm (not AM/PM), with a space: 9 am, 3.30 pm

## Capitalisation

- **Job titles**: lowercase unless directly before a name (the CEO said... / CEO Jane Smith said...)
- **Teams and departments**: lowercase (the engineering team, the marketing department)
- **Product names**: as the product spells them
- **After colons**: lowercase unless it's a proper noun or a complete sentence that stands alone

## Punctuation

- **Em dashes**: use with spaces either side ( — ) not without (—). One or two per paragraph max.
- **Ellipsis**: three dots with no spaces before or after (like this...)
- **Quotation marks**: double for direct quotes, single for 'scare quotes' or terms being introduced
